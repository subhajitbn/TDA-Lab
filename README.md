# TDA-Lab
A collection of hands-on experiments designed to teach and learn topological data analysis (TDA). These exercises are inspired by Peter Bubenik's [Topological Data Analysis with R](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/peterbubenik/intro-to-tda/), Henry Adams' [Applied Topology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4kY-dS_mSmLFh9BpI3LqIQnw6KMg0jlt) lecture series, and Katherine Benjamin's [Topological Data Analysis Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qXOdF1_nm8&ab_channel=LOGMLSummerSchool).

The notebooks contain videos for better visualization of 3D point clouds. Pass them through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) to watch the videos. For e.g., [TDA_Lab_1](https://github.com/subhajitbn/TDA-Lab/blob/main/TDA_Lab_1.ipynb), [TDA_Lab_2](https://github.com/subhajitbn/TDA-Lab/blob/main/TDA_Lab_2.ipynb).

# Notebooks
This repository currently includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **[TDA_Lab_1](TDA_Lab_1.ipynb)** – Analyzing point clouds sampled from an annulus and a torus. We visualize the point clouds, compute Vietoris-Rips complexes, and generate persistence diagrams and persistence landscapes.
2. **[TDA_Lab_2](TDA_Lab_2.ipynb)** – Focused on persistence landscapes, this notebook examines datasets sampled from a circle, an annulus, and a torus. We create multiple sets of persistence landscapes, apply permutation tests for statistical analysis, and compare the results, including a comparison between two torus datasets.
3. **TDA_Lab_3** – Persistence images. Ongoing...
